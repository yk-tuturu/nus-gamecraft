<h3><i>What would you like to drink today?</i></h3>
<p>This was a gamejam submission to NUS GameCraft 2025! Based on the theme of "1, 2, 3", we have created a cafe simulation game where you have to brew your lattes to the beat of the music. Serve your underwater customers before they run out of patience. </p>
<p>Play the game here--> https://tuturu-owo.itch.io/sharkbeatcafe</p>
